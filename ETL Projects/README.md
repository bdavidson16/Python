Here I showcase a few ETL Pipelines that I have completed, mainly for school or certificate assignments but there are one or two I have attempted as a personal project.


🗣️"*If you are a pursuing data analyst, why are you spending time on data engineering and pipelines?*"

Good Question! My answer is two-fold:

1. The 📈***growth of unstructured data*** continues at outstanding rates. Not only are large businesses already encompassing social media and other unstructured data into their business models, but small/medium sized companies are emerging and realizing that they don’t need all of this data. They do not need all of it to be cleaned and ready for immediate use, that costs money and time. Thus, NoSQL, data lakes, cloud-based services, etc., are becoming more popular by the day. So at the end of the day, I need to be in the *data* loop.
   
3. I am an advocate for 🤝***cross training***. I understand that this may be completely out of my job description once I step into the field, however these two jobs are not unrelated. In fact, one leads to another. Especially since I would love to dive into AI/ML, data engineering is not too far off. That being said, I feel that knowing at least a base knowledge of data engineering can help me and my future team succeed. Whether it be for understanding project deadlines and planning out tasks or if I have to help out my team when someone is unexpectedly out.
