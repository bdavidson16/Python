# Python
Here I document a summary of my Python projects with a description of each project and what skills I showcase within the project. I have some experience with Data Engineering and have provided a few ETL/ELT projects.

## Data Cleaing/Analysis/ML
| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| ‚ò†Ô∏è [COVID19 Twitter Feed](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/COVID19_Twitter_Feed%20(1).ipynb) | Programming | This repo contains the solution to the problem sets in [Harvardx CS50P Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python). | - |  
| üè† [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/House%20Price%20Prediction%20(1)%20(1).ipynb) | EDA & Data Prepping for ML or Visualization | Analysis on Housing prices and how their features affect these prices. Then, cleaning the data based on EDA for preparation for further analysis, hopefully machine learning. Also, this cleaned data could be visualized in Power BI/Tableau for a complete, initial look at the data. |  pandas, matplotlib |   
| üßë‚Äçüéì [Student Mental Health](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/Student%20Mental%20Health.ipynb) | Data Wrangling, EDA, Visualization | Analysis of student mental health based on yes/no answers to if the student is married, has depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and/or if they are seeing a specicialist for their mental health, compared to demographic information. I chose to use Python for this project so I can clean the data, aggregate for EDA, and then immediately begin to create some visuals to emphasize trends. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |
| üëû [Zomato](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/Zomato%20(1)%20(1).ipynb) | EDA & Visualization | EDA of Zomato, an online food delivery and restaurant reservation service based in India. Python is used for this project to clean the data and then immediately create several different visuals, such as histograms and boxplots, to identify relationships amongst the data. | pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn |

## Data Engineering
| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| üí∞ [ETL](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/ETL%20Projects/ETL_toll_data.py) |   Data Wrangling & EDA | I analysed more than 10,000 TMDb movies and getting the answers to - Which actor(s) is associated with higher revenue and profit, Does a higher budget constitute to a higher profit, and Which director produced the highest grossing movie? | pandas, matplotlib | 
| üè† [ETL Pipeline for Currency Exchange Rates](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/ETL%20Projects/Final_Project_for_Py_Google_Analytics_Cert.ipynb) | Web-scraping, ETL in Python | I extracted data by scraping a wikipedia page with information on banks around the world and loading it into a pandas' dataframe. I also loaded a separate CSV file with information used to calculate the exchange_rate. Then I cleaned, manipulated and exported the data it into both a CSV file and SQLite database. |  BeautifulSoup, pandas, CSV, SQLite |
| üßë‚Äçüéì [Student Mental Health](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/Student%20Mental%20Health.ipynb) | Data Wrangling, EDA, Visualization | Analysis of student mental health based on yes/no answers to if the student is married, has depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and/or if they are seeing a specicialist for their mental health, compared to demographic information. I chose to use Python for this project so I can clean the data, aggregate for EDA, and then immediately begin to create some visuals to emphasize trends. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |
| üëû [Zomato](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/Zomato%20(1)%20(1).ipynb) | EDA & Visualization | EDA of Zomato, an online food delivery and restaurant reservation service based in India.
