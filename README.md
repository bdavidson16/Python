# Python
Here I document a summary of my Python projects with a description of each project and what skills I showcase within the project.


| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| ‚ò†Ô∏è [COVID19 Twitter Feed](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/COVID19_Twitter_Feed%20(1).ipynb) | Programming | This repo contains the solution to the problem sets in [Harvardx CS50P Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python). | - | 
| üí∞ [ETL](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/Final_Project_for_Py_Course%20(1).ipynb) |   Data Wrangling & EDA | I analysed more than 10,000 TMDb movies and getting the answers to - Which actor(s) is associated with higher revenue and profit, Does a higher budget constitute to a higher profit, and Which director produced the highest grossing movie? | pandas, matplotlib |   
| üè† [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/House%20Price%20Prediction%20(1)%20(1).ipynb) | EDA & Data Prepping for ML or Visualization | Analysis on Housing prices and how their features affect these prices. Then, cleaning the data based on EDA for preparation for further analysis, hopefully machine learning. Also, this cleaned data could be visualized in Power BI/Tableau for a complete, initial look at the data. |  pandas, matplotlib |   
| üßë‚Äçüéì [Student Mental Health](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/Student%20Mental%20Health.ipynb) | Data Wrangling & EDA | A study on red and white wine samples and understanding whether certain types of wine and their qualities (alcohol level, sugar content and acidity level) are associated with higher wine quality. | pandas, matplotlib |   
| üëû [Zomato](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/blob/main/Zomato%20(1)%20(1).ipynb) | Time-series analysis | In this time-series analysis, I use moving average method to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. | pandas, matplotlib |
